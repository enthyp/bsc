# LESSONS (kind of reinventing the wheel here):
#  - precisely define requirements using User Stories and Actors
#  - (simultaneously) figure out potential entities in the system,
#    like Channels, ClientEndpoints, Manager etc. and translate
#    User Stories into terms of their interactions. At this point
#    you plot finite state machines, flow control diagrams and the
#    like
#  - create well defined and granular issues from these interactions
#  - before implementation, consider responsibilities of interacting
#    objects, then what state they need to keep to do their job etc.


# Responsible for:
#  - creating Channel instances and keeping them in memory
#  - connecting incoming clients with requested channels
